# Trench Warfare: Creating and Analyzing Defensive Line Positions

This was our submission to SportsInfoSolution's 2020 Analytics Competition. In this project we employ different machine learning techniques to define defensive line poisition. We analyze each position's performance in a multitude of ways and also measure their value based on their contract. 

Our submission was mentioned mentioned in SIS's article that highlighted some of the better submissions. You can view that article with the link here:
